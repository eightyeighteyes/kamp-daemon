# Backlog

> Estimates use the vinyl scale: Single (<0.5), Side (0.5–1), LP (2), 2xLP (4), Box Set (4–8), Discography (>8)
> ⚠️ = needs scoping before work can start

## Full Windows Support
*Box Set* — prerequisite: Rebrand must ship first. Breakdown:

| Component | Estimate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows tray app (pystray, full parity) | LP | pystray is pull-based (menus rebuilt on open); status animation needs background icon-swap thread; no inline status text like rumps |
| Windows CI (GitHub Actions `windows-latest`) | Side | Subprocess spawn differences, path separator edge cases, likely several test fixes |
| Playwright on Windows | Side | Chromium download + DevTools Protocol over localhost; verify subprocess isolation pattern holds |
| Windows service install (NSSM) | Side | NSSM wraps the CLI; simpler to manage start/stop than Task Scheduler |
| Chocolatey packaging | Side | `.nuspec`, install/uninstall scripts, community repo submission (review queue can take weeks) |
| Path/config conventions (`%APPDATA%`) | Single | `pathlib` handles most of it; needs an audit pass |

Target: Windows 10/11 only. Distribution via Chocolatey.
## Cross-platform service installation (Linux systemd, Windows Task Scheduler)
*Side* — Linux systemd unit file is straightforward; Windows Task Scheduler adds another side; can ship incrementally

# Needs Refinement
## Bug: MusicBrainz Release Id tag casing
⚠️ Needs repro steps — a lowercase tag was observed in the wild but the tagger writes `MusicBrainz Release Id` (mixed case). May be a tag coming from MusicBrainz data rather than a write bug. Needs a concrete example file or log showing the bad tag before scoping a fix.

## Investigate: main process inflates ~50 MB when Bandcamp sync starts and never recovers
*⚠️ LP* — subprocess isolation is implemented (syncer and pipeline both spawn via `multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")`) but the main process grows from ~35 MB to ~83 MB when sync starts and stays there after sync ends. An additional ~8 MB subprocess also lingers after sync completes. The subprocess workers themselves are not the resident cost — something in the parent or in the IPC setup is loading heavy modules or retaining allocations. Requires profiling (e.g. `tracemalloc`, `psutil` RSS snapshots before/after sync, `sys.modules` diff) to identify what is inflating memory in the parent and why it is not released. Scoping question: is the 50 MB growth from the queues / pickling overhead of passing `Config` objects, from a remaining import triggered at IPC setup time, or from OS-level page retention after multiprocessing fork-related copy-on-write?

## Best Release
*Side* — when multiple MB results exist, prefer the release closest to the original physical format (LP/CD over digital/streaming)

⚠️ Needs scoping: what ranking heuristic? (release format field, country, date proximity?) and what's the fallback when no physical release exists? Note: date-based tie-breaking (earliest release wins) is already implemented; remaining work is format/country preference.

## Nested Folders
*Side* — when a folder-of-folders is dropped into staging, recurse into subdirectories and treat each leaf folder as an album

⚠️ Needs scoping: does each subfolder get its own MusicBrainz lookup? How are mixed-album folders handled?

## Configurable Album Art Search
⚠️ Not scoped enough to start — each source (Bandcamp, Apple, Spotify, Qobuz) requires its own API integration and auth flow; estimate per source is ~Side to LP. Needs a design pass on the config schema and fallback order before any source is implemented.

## Allow a user to verify tags before they're written
⚠️ Not scoped — needs UI design (CLI prompt? TUI? GUI?) before estimating

## bug: macOS menu bar app reads "About Tune-Shifter" instead of "About Kamp"
*Single* — leftover hardcoded string from the rebrand, likely in `menu_bar.py` or `__main__.py`.

## Library scan progress UI
⚠️ Not scoped — the `LibraryScanner` runs synchronously and returns a `ScanResult`, but there is no UI feedback during a scan. Needs a design pass: progress bar in first-run setup flow, status indicator during background re-scans, and whether large libraries need the scan to run in a worker thread/subprocess to avoid blocking the UI.

## Automatic library watching
*Side* — `LibraryScanner` is incremental but must be triggered manually. The existing `watchdog` infrastructure in `watcher.py` should be extended to watch the library directory (in addition to staging) and call `LibraryScanner.scan()` on changes. Needs scoping: debounce strategy, whether a full rescan or path-targeted upsert is preferred, and how to avoid re-scanning during an active ingest pipeline run.
