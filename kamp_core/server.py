"""FastAPI application for the Kamp music player.

create_app() wires together a LibraryIndex, MpvPlaybackEngine, and
PlaybackQueue into a REST + WebSocket API.  The caller is responsible for
constructing and owning those objects; the server holds references only.

REST base: /api/v1/
WebSocket:  /api/v1/ws   — client sends "ping", server replies with a
                           player.state snapshot; initial snapshot is pushed
                           on connect.
