## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a settings UI where users can view installed extensions, enable/disable them, and configure per-extension settings. Extensions declare their settings schema in their manifest; the host renders the settings form.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Settings screen lists all installed extensions with name, version, and enabled state
- [x] #2 User can enable/disable extensions from the UI
- [x] #3 Per-extension settings are rendered from the extension's declared schema
- [x] #4 Settings changes take effect without requiring an app restart
- [x] #5 First load of a community extension shows a permission prompt listing its declared permissions; the extension only loads after explicit user approval

## Implementation Plan

### Files changed
- `kamp_ui/src/shared/kampAPI.ts` — added `ExtensionSettingSchema` type; added `version` and `settings?` to `ExtensionInfo`; added `settings?` API to `KampAPI`
- `kamp_ui/src/main/extensions.ts` — reads `version` and `kamp.settings` schema from package.json; validates schema entries
- `kamp_ui/src/renderer/src/hooks/useExtensionState.ts` (new) — localStorage-backed state for disabled set, approved/denied sets, per-extension setting values
- `kamp_ui/src/renderer/src/components/ExtensionPermissionPrompt.tsx` (new) — permission approval modal for Phase 2 community extensions
- `kamp_ui/src/renderer/src/components/PreferencesDialog.tsx` — added tab bar (General | Extensions); Extensions tab renders ExtensionsPanel with per-extension rows (toggle, badge, Configure drawer)
- `kamp_ui/src/renderer/src/App.tsx` — wired useExtensionState; filters disabled extensions; routes Phase 2 through approved/denied/pending sets; shows permission prompt queue; passes settings API to Phase 1 extensions with the 'settings' permission
- `kamp_ui/src/renderer/src/assets/main.css` — tab bar, toggle switch, extension rows, phase badge, configure drawer, empty state, permission prompt dialog

### Key design decisions
- **Enable/disable**: disabling marks the id in localStorage; takes effect on next load (reload badge shown). Enabling an extension that was disabled re-triggers the load effect because `disabledIds` is in the effect dependency array.
- **Per-extension settings (AC#4)**: values live in localStorage; `KampAPI.settings.get(key)` reads directly from the store at any time — no restart required. Only available when the extension declares the `'settings'` permission.
- **Permission prompt (AC#5)**: Phase 2 extensions not yet in approved/denied sets go into a pending queue. App shows one prompt at a time via `permissionQueue[0]`. Approve → extension loads in its iframe; Deny → skipped, not prompted again.
- **Settings schema**: extensions declare `kamp.settings` in package.json as an array of `{key, label, type, options?, default?, hint?}`. The host renders `text`, `number`, `boolean` (toggle), and `select` field types.

## Implementation Notes

## Sandboxed iframe debugging — lessons learned

**srcdoc iframes inherit the parent document's CSP.** Even if the srcdoc carries its own `<meta http-equiv=Content-Security-Policy>`, the parent's CSP overrides it for script-src. The only way to permit an inline script is to hash-whitelist it in the parent's CSP (`'sha256-...'`). The hash must be recomputed every time the shim changes.

**Sandboxed iframes without allow-same-origin reload on DOM move.** The original holding-area/move strategy (move iframe into visible container on mount, back to holding div on unmount) caused the iframe to reload every time it was moved in the DOM. Chromium treats these iframes as cross-origin and navigates them on reparent. Solution: create a fresh iframe on each panel mount.

**Race condition: kamp:panel-mount arrives before async import() resolves.** Sending kamp:init and kamp:panel-mount synchronously in the same onLoad callback means panel-mount is processed by the shim before the dynamic import() inside kamp:init completes. The render fn (r[panelId]) is still empty. Fix: buffer the pending mount in the shim and fire it inside panels.register() if it arrived early.

**iframe CSP needs img-src for server images.** The srcdoc CSP `default-src 'none'` blocks image loads. Must explicitly add `img-src http://127.0.0.1:8000` to allow album art from the kamp server.
