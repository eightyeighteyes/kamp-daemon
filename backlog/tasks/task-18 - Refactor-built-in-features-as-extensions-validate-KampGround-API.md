## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Refactor the Bandcamp syncer, MusicBrainz tagger, and artwork fetcher to use the public `KampGround` API as if they were third-party extensions. This validates that the API is sufficient for real use.

Per the architecture: if this is painful, stop and fix the API first before proceeding. The goal is to confirm that all built-in features are buildable using only the public extension SDK.

Depends on the extension host and KampGround API task.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 MusicBrainz tagger and artwork fetcher use only the public KampGround API (Bandcamp syncer deferred to TASK-18.1)
- [ ] #2 No built-in feature accesses daemon internals directly
- [ ] #3 All existing tests pass after refactor
- [ ] #4 Any API gaps discovered during refactor are fixed in the KampGround API before this task closes
<!-- AC:END -->
