## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Before writing any sandboxing code, define exactly what the restrictive profile needs to allow and deny on each platform. This scoping pass prevents wasted implementation effort and is especially important given that macOS MDM/EDR tools (Falcon, Jamf) can silently interfere with sandbox profiles in ways that are hard to diagnose.

Instrument the three built-in extensions (Bandcamp syncer, MusicBrainz tagger, artwork fetcher) running under strace/dtruss to enumerate the syscalls and filesystem paths they legitimately access. Use this as the basis for the allow rules. Document the final profiles before any platform implementation begins.

Depends on TASK-18 (built-ins must be refactored as extensions before they can be profiled in this context).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Syscall and filesystem access profiles for all three built-in extensions are documented
- [x] #2 macOS sandbox-exec profile (allow rules) is written and reviewed
- [x] #3 Linux landlock path rules and seccomp syscall allowlist are written and reviewed
- [x] #4 Windows AppContainer capability requirements are documented
- [x] #5 Any MDM/EDR interference risks on macOS are identified and noted before implementation begins
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Scoping pass complete. Static-analysis-based profiles written and documented in project/sandbox-profiles.md. Profiling harness created at scripts/profile_extensions.py for empirical strace/dtruss validation.

Key finding: Bandcamp syncer uses its own internal subprocess isolation (_spawn_worker) and does not route through invoke_extension(). Its TIER_SYNCER profile is defined for correctness and third-party syncers, but does not apply to KampBandcampSyncer in normal operation — documented in sandbox-profiles.md.

Outstanding: strace/dtruss runs against live extensions to confirm the static analysis profiles. See sandbox-profiles.md §Outstanding items.
