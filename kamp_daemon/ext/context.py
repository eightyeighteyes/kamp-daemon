"""KampGround: the host API surface available to backend extensions.

KampGround is a picklable snapshot object constructed by the host before
spawning a worker subprocess. Extensions receive it via their constructor
and use it to query library state, read playback state, make proxied network
requests, and register event callbacks. All fields are Python primitives or
other picklable types — no file paths, database cursors, or internal daemon
objects ever appear here.

Usage (extension author perspective)::

    class MyTagger(BaseTagger):
        def __init__(self, ctx: KampGround) -> None:
            self._ctx = ctx

        def tag(self, track: TrackMetadata) -> TrackMetadata:
            # Query the library snapshot
            related = self._ctx.search(track.album)
            # Fetch data from the network (requires network.domains declaration)
            resp = self._ctx.fetch("https://example.com/api")
            return track
