class BaseSyncer(ABC):
    """Polls an external source and deposits new downloads into staging.

    Implementations run in-process within the daemon — the extension host
    already provides process isolation, so a nested subprocess is not needed.
    Third-party syncers that cannot write to the filesystem directly should
    call ``ctx.stage(filename, content)`` to deposit files; the host writes
    them to the staging directory.

    Lifecycle
    ---------
    ``DaemonCore`` calls the following methods in order::

        syncer.start()        # begin background polling
        syncer.pause()        # temporarily stop polling (e.g. pipeline pause)
        syncer.resume()       # restart polling after pause
        syncer.stop()         # final shutdown; join background thread

    The default implementations of ``pause`` and ``resume`` delegate to
    ``stop`` / ``start`` respectively.  Override them if the implementation
    can cheaply suspend without fully tearing down (e.g. by setting an event).

    Manual triggers
    ---------------
    ``sync_once`` and ``mark_synced`` are optional capabilities.  Override
    them to support manual sync triggers (e.g. a "Sync now" menu item).
